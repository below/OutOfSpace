# Out Of Space
## A Lego Dimensions Project for macOS

Now that Lego Dimensions seems to be reaching end-of-life as of early 2026, I got my hands on a used toy pad.
This macOS add uses the [DimensionPad package](https://github.com/below/DimensionPad), and provides a SwiftUI wrapper for it.

As of this writing, I think I support all features of the toy pad:

* Detecting Tags
* Reading Tags
* Lights and Color
* Fade & Flash
* Writing Tags
* Even writing to blank NFC tags

The later became handy because when buying used Dimension Toys, sometimes you get the wrong vehicle tags ...
